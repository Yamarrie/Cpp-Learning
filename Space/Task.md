Task:

Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.

Write a space.cpp program that helps him keep track of his target weight by:

1. It should ask him what his earth weight is.
2. Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on.
3. It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.
4. Here is the table of conversion:

#	Planet	Relative Gravity
1	Venus	0.78
2	Mars	0.39
3	Jupiter	2.65
4	Saturn	1.17
5	Uranus	1.05
6	Neptune	1.23
